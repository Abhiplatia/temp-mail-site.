            <h3>Can I create multiple temp emails quickly?</h3>
            <p>After creating temp mail in 10 seconds, you can generate a new address by refreshing the page or waiting for the current one to expire. Each generation takes the same 10 seconds.

QuickTempMail generates addresses instantly without accounts, passwords, or personal information. This zero-registration approach makes temporary email truly temporary—nothing about you is stored, tracked, or associated with the service. Complete anonymity is built into the 10-second process.</p>
            
            <h3>Is there a limit to how many times I can create temp mail?</h3>
            <p>No daily limits exist for creating temp mail in 10 seconds on QuickTempMail. You can generate new addresses as often as needed—hundreds per day if necessary. The service doesn't track individual users or impose artificial restrictions. This unlimited access makes QuickTempMail suitable for both occasional users needing one address monthly and power users requiring dozens daily for testing, development, or privacy protection.</p>
